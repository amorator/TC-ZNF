Keyboard Shortcuts

Global (all pages):

- Click outside modal: Close the modal (with the same recording safeguards).

Files page (table):
- Double-click on a data row: Open the video in the player modal.

Player modal (popup-view):
- F (physical key, works in any keyboard layout): Toggle fullscreen for the video player.
- M (physical key, works in any keyboard layout): Toggle mute for the video player.
- P or Space: Toggle play/pause for the audio/video player (works when the player modal is open).

Recording modal (iframe):
- Enter: If recording, stop then save; otherwise, save (if data present).
- Esc: Stop recording.
- The Save button is hidden until recording starts; after a successful save it hides again.

Notes:
- Pagination and search states persist across soft refreshes.
- The table updates live via Socket.IO without page reloads.
- Admin page: right-click anywhere for “Обновить”; right-click on logs for copy or download actions; double-click a log to view as text.
